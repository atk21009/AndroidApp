# Android App - News API Android Application

The software demonstrated in this project is an Andriod Application written in Java. This application pulls News articles from an API and displays the headlines, related image, source and a brief description of the article. The user is then able to search for specific generas of news and Search for news articles and the application will display those. The API is very limited to what It can pull and use however, so there is quite a bottle neck on the API used. However, for this project it was used for proof of concept.

The purpose of writing this software was to create an application that can display multiple news articles from multiple news outlets. This application gives a description of all of the articles, who published them and an image relating to the article. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

In order to develop this software application I used Java, Android Studio, and various references. The references I used was [Android Development Docs](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app#0), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp), and [Java Oracle References](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/index.html).

The programming language I used for developing this application was Java. Java is an object oriented programming language. In which I used this language to create mutliple pages and functionality to those pages.

# Future Work

- One step that I would take for future improvement would be to add more functionality to my application. Right now the application is kind of stale and lacks content.
- Better API usage; Right now with the current API I am using it acts like a bottle neck. It only gives a limited amount of information and articles, so if I had more time I would look for other APIs that provide a better service.
- Subscribe feature; Implementing a subscribe feature would add a lot more functionality to my application. Being able to receive additional articles based on subscriptions, and receiving notifications for articles published by that source(s).
- Implement a pay feature to get access to specific content on my application. Like premium news articles or special features.
